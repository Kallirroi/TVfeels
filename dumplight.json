McMASTER AS THE\nINTERNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.\nTHAT DOESN'T MEAN McMASTER HAS\nBEEN FIRED YET.\nTHE PRESIDENT'S TAKING SOME TIME\nTO EXECUTE THE DECISION IN PART\nBECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO\nHUMILIATE McMASTER AND WANTS TO\nHAVE A REPLACEMENT LINED UP TO\nSUCCEED HIM.\nAFTER OUR REPORTING WAS\nPUBLISHED CAME THE TWEET FROM\nPRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS\nWHO PUSHED BACK, BUT SHE DID NOT\nEXPLICITLY DENY WHAT WE HAVE\nREPORTED, THAT A DECISION HAD\nBEEN MADE IN THE MIND OF THE\nPRESIDENT AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING\nFROM SOURCES IS THAT THE\nPRESIDENT'S TELLING DIFFERENT\nPEOPLE DIFFERENT THINGS AND\nDIFFERENT SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE\nDIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF\nWHERE McMASTER STANDS AT THIS\nHOUR.\n>> AND JON, PERHAPS THE\nPRESIDENT -- HE'S NEVER REALLY\nGOTTEN McMASTER.\nWE HEARD THE FIRST WEEK OR SO\nTHAT McMASTER WAS THERE HE, YOU\nKNOW, THE GENERAL HAD THE\nAUDACITY TO GIVE HIM MORE THAN A\nONE PAGE MEMO AND NOT TO SPEAK\nIN A QUICK SOUND BYTE AND SO THE\nPRESIDENT NEVER REALLY GOT IT.\n>> PHIL AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE\nAN INCREDIBLY WELL SOURCED PIECE\nLAST NIGHT BUT THE WALL STREET\nJOURNAL REPORTED THE SAME THING.\nSO THE WEIGHT OF THE REPORTING\nSUGGESTS THIS IS TRUE.\nI JUST FIND IT HILARIOUS, THIS\nNOTION REFLECTING THE THINKING\nOF THE PRESIDENT THAT HE DOESN'T\nWANT TO HUMILIATE McMASTER.\nIF HE DIDN'T WANT TO HUMILIATE\nHIM HE WOULD REPLACE HIM IN A\nCRISP CLEAN WAY.\nINSTEAD HE'S GOT HIM OUT THERE\nTWISTING IN THE WIND WITH\nCONFLICTING REPORTS AND SARAH\nSANDERS ON TWITTER SAYING NO.\nTHIS IS THE MOST HUMILITY YOU\nCOULD GO THROUGH, THE TWISTING\nIN THE WIND AND LACK OF CLARITY\nWHERE YOU THINK YOUR JOB IS\nBLOWING HITHER AND YON\nTHROUGHOUT THE WHITE HOUSE.\n>> AND THE GENERAL DOESN'T SEEM\nREALLY TO BE PHASED BY IT.\nHE WANTS HIS FORWARD STAR BUT\nALSO GIVES HIM THE OPPORTUNITY\nTO SPEAK OUT AS AGGRESSIVELY AS\nHE WANTS ON RUSSIA OR ANY OTHER\nTOPIC THAT MATTERS TO HIM.\n>> I THINK IT DOES BOTHER HIM,\nJOE, GETTING BATTERED LIKE THIS.\nHE'S BEEN SUBJECT TO A CAMPAIGN\nOF LEAKS BY STEVE BANNON\nSUPPORTERS, OTHER -- OTHER\nCRITICS GOING BACK FOR A YEAR\nAND IT TAKES ITS TOLL.\nH.R. McMASTER TO HIS CREDIT\nKEEPS TRYING TO SAY MA HE REALLY\nTHINKS.\nI SAW HIM IN MUNICH TWO WEEKS\nAGO WHERE HE JUST FLAT OUT SAID\nTHAT RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR WAS\nINEXCUSABLE, CONTRADICTED THE\nPRESIDENT'S LINE AT THE TIME\nTHAT WAS MUCH LESS CRITICAL AND\nYOU COULD ALMOST SENSE THIS\nFEELING THAT McMASTER HAD.\nI'M GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH THE\nWAY I SEE IT NO MATTER WHAT.\nBUT THE IDEA THAT THIS IS NOT\nHUMILIATING FOR A MAN WHO'S\nSERVED HIS COUNTRY IN DIFFICULT\nPLACES NOW FOR DECADES, IT'S\nREALLY HUMILIATING.\n>> I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY\nDANGEROUS.\nSENATOR SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS\nAN UNCONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT\nSTYLE.\n>> HE HAS NO MANAGEMENT STYLE.\nWE KEEP FORGETTING HE'S NOT RUN\nANYTHING.\nHE'S NEVER HIRED OR FIRED AN\nEXECUTIVE IN HIS LIFE.\nYOU KNOW, AM ROS IS ONE OF HIS\nMORE SENIOR EXECUTIVES SO BEYOND\nTHE INCREDIBLE INSIGHT THAT HE\nCHANGES HIS MIND WHICH IS\nPROBABLY PRETTY SIMPLY STATED,\nTHIS IS A GUY, PHIL, WHO NEVER\nEVER BEYOND HIS MIND THAT'S ALL\nOVER THE PLACE HAS ANY\nUNDERSTANDING, HAS ANY TOUCH IN\nTERMS OF MANAGEMENT, IN TERMS OF\nFIRING, IN TERMS OF HIRING, IN\nTERMS OF STAG -- STAFFING.\n>> HE -- YOU KNOW, DON'T HAVE A\nBIG MANAGEMENT BACKGROUND IN\nTERMS OF RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT\nAND MANAGING OTHER PRINCIPALS\nBUT HE'S BEEN PRESIDENT FOR 14\nMONTHS AND HE'S TELLING THEM I'M\nGOING TO HIRE AND FIRE AS I\nCHOOSE.\nHE HAS A GUT SENSE OF WHAT HE\nTHINKS OF ALL THESE CABINET\nSECRETARIES.\nTHERE ARE A NUMBER THAT HE\nLIKES, ESPECIALLY STEVE MNUCHIN\nBUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY ON THIN\nICE RIGHT NOW INCLUDING AND AT\nTHE TOP OF THAT LIST WOULD BE\nDAVID SHULKIN.\n>> IF YOU READ THE REPORTING\nTHERE ARE SO MANY ECHOS OF REX\nTILLER AND THAT IT'S ALMOST\nPURELY PERSONAL.\nTHAT HE DIDN'T LIKE REX\nTILLERSON BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE\nWAS CONDESCENDING.\nTHESE ARE MEN WITH EXPERTISE AND\nTHE PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE BEING\nEXPLAINED TO.\n>> HE DOESN'T LIKE RECEIVING\nTHAT EXPERTISE.\n>> CAN I SAY ONE THING, A NORMAL\nADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW THIS\nIS THE LEAST NORMAL\nADMINISTRATION WE'VE COVERED.\nWE JUST ANNOUNCED WE'RE GOING TO\nHAVE A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE\nPRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN ON\nNUCLEAR WEAPONS.\nSINCE THEN THE SECRETARY OF\nSTATE HAS BEEN FIRED AND THE\nNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR SEEMS\nTO BE HANGING BY A THREAD.\nIN WHAT SENSE DOES IT MEAN TO\nTAKE TO FIRE THEM IN THE FIVE OR\nSIX WEEK WINDOW BEFORE A\nSUPPOSED SUMMIT TO TAKE PLACE\nWITH KIM JONG-UN?\n>> THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE\nDEFENSE THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS\nTO GET HIS TEAM IN PLACE.\n>> LET'S NOT FORGET WHEN DONALD\nTRUMP ANNOUNCED HIS TEAM, THERE\nWERE FOUR PEOPLE THAT EVERYONE\nWAS REALLY HAPPY WITH.\nMATTIS McMASTER, KELLY AND\nTILLERSON AND EVERYONE SAID\nTHAT'S A TEAM THAT WE CAN TRUST.\nSO WE WON'T JUDGE TOO HARSHLY.\nHE'S GOTTEN RID OF 50% OF THAT\nTEAM.\n>> THIS IS NOT CASTING.\nTHIS IS A CABINET.\n>> THIS IS NOT CASTING.\nTHIS IS FRIGHTENING AND YOUR\nPIECE IN THIS IS NOT A FIRE\nDRILL IN THE WOUG POST IS THE\nFIRST THING THAT I'VE READ THAT\nGIVES ME HOPE WE'RE GOING TO BE\nOKAY BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SCARY\nTIME WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT\nTHIS.\nIT'S NOT FUNNY.\n>> BUT IF YOU LOOK AT HIS\nFOREIGN POLICY TEAM --\n>> IT'S FRIGHTENING.\n>> I KNOW WE HAVE TO GO BUT THE\nSECRETARY OF DEFENSE AS WELL AS\nTHE INCOMING SECRETARY OF STATE,\nIF MIKE POMPEO GETS PAST\nCONFIRMATION, THOSE ARE TWO\nPEOPLE THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE\nCONFIDENCE IN AND ARE THEY NOT\nON SOMEWHAT FIRMER GROUND THAN\nTHESE OTHER PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN\nMENTIONING?\n>> IT'S CLEAR THAT POMPEO AND\nTRUMP HAVE A UNIQUELY GOOD\nRELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF THIS\nADMINISTRATION.\nEVERY PRESIDENT NEED TO HAVE A\nSECRETARY OF STATE THAT SPEAKS\nFOR HIM AND POMPEO MIGHT BE THAT\nPERSON.\nI WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT\nGENERAL MATTIS.\nOUTSTANDING COMMANDER, A PERSON\nWHO'S RUN THE PENTAGON WELL.\nDOES HE FEEL HIS CONNECTION WITH\nTHE PRESIDENT AND DECISIONS HAS\nBEEN DIMINISHED BY THE FIRING OF\nHIS CLOSE FRIEND AND ALLY, REX\nTILLERSON.\nTHAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO\nWATCH CLOSELY.\n>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.\n>>> COMING UP, THE FORMER FBI\nDIRECTOR IS WAITING TO LEARN IF\nHE'LL BE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH HIS\nPENSION OR IF HE'LL HAVE TO\nRETIRE WITHOUT IT.\nMEANWHILE HIS FORMER BOSS, JAMES\nCOMEY WHO WAS DEFINITELY FIRED\nIS SET TO GET HIS REVENGE.\nNEW REPORTING ON THAT AHEAD ON\n\"MORNING JOE.\"\n<i>You can't predict</i>\n<i>the market,</i>\n<i>but through good</i>\n<i>times and bad</i>\n<i>at T.
